Brain Networks and Learning (BraiNets)
-----

BraiNets is a research team of the `Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone <http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/>`_ (Marseille, France) created in January 2020 focusing on cognitive computational neuroscience.

The main research themes and techniques are:

- Neural and computational bases of learning and adaptive behaviors
- Information dynamics and emergence of cognitive brain networks
- Model free and model based brain networks analysis
- Multimodal neuroimaging techniques (MEG, intracranial EEG and fMRI)
- Neural networks models bio mimetic robotics
- Bayesian modelling and reinforcement learning
- Machine learning
