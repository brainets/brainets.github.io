Brain Networks and Learning (BraiNets)
-----

BraiNets is a research team of the `Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone <http://www.int.univ-amu.fr/>`_ (Marseille, France) created in January 2020 focusing on cognitive computational neuroscience. 

The main axes of research are:

- Neural and computational bases of learning and adaptive behaviors
- Brain networks and functional connectivity
- Information dynamics and emergence of cognitive brain networks
- Human neurophysiology (MEG, SEEG) and neuroimaging (fMRI)
- Neural networks models
- Bayesian modelling
- Machine learning
