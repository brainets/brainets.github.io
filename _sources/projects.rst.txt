**Cognitive architectures of causal learning**

Funding: Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR, 2019-2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Mateus Joffily (GATE, Lyon), Mehdi Khamassi (ISIR, Paris), Julien Bastin (GIN, Grenoble)

*The aim of this project is to study the neural and computational bases of human goal-directed causal learning by combining human neurophysiology (MEG and intracranial SEEG) and neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques with computational models of learning (Reinforcement Learning and Active Inference)*

**Model-free and model-based inference and validation workflows for causal brain network discovery**

Funding: Human Brain Project HBP/EBRAINS, 2020-2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Etienne Combrisson (post-doc INT), Jean Daunizeau (ICM, Paris), Gustavo Deco (UPF, Barcelona), Stefano Panzeri (IIT, Italy), Petra Ritter (Charité, Berlin), Olivier David (GIN, Grenoble)

The project aims at combining data-driven and model-based approaches for the inference of brain causal connectivity and the validation of whole-brain models. The goal is to integrate workflows and methods into EBRAINS. This projet is part of WP1 of SGA3 of the HBP.
