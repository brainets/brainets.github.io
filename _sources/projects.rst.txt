**Cognitive architectures of causal learning**

Funding: Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR - PRC, Jan 2019 - Jun 2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Mateus Joffily (GATE, Lyon), Mehdi Khamassi (ISIR, Paris), Julien Bastin (GIN, Grenoble)

*The aim of this project is to study the neural and computational bases of human goal-directed causal learning by combining human neurophysiology (MEG and intracranial SEEG) and neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques with computational models of learning (Reinforcement Learning and Active Inference).*

**Model-free and model-based inference and validation workflows for causal brain network discovery**

Funding: Human Brain Project HBP/EBRAINS, Oct 2020 - March 2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Jean Daunizeau (ICM, Paris), Gustavo Deco (UPF, Barcelona), Stefano Panzeri (IIT, Italy), Petra Ritter (Charité, Berlin), Olivier David (GIN, Grenoble)

*The project aims at combining data-driven and model-based approaches for the inference of brain causal connectivity and the validation of whole-brain models. The goal is to integrate workflows and methods into EBRAINS. This projet is part of WP1 of SGA3 of the HBP.*

**Robots aériens agiles bio-mimetiques pour le vol en conditions réelles**

Funding : Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR - PRC, March 2021 - Sept 2024

Consortium:  Emmanuel Daucé (Partner), Laurent Perrinet (PI), Ryad Benosman (IDV, Paris), Stéphane Viollet (ISM, Marseille)

*In this project, we propose a solution that will integrate bio-inspired rapid visual detection and stabilization dynamics into an end-to-end event based neuromorphic system. The key to this approach will be the optimization of delays through predictive processing. This will allow these robots to fly independently, without any user intervention.*

**Modelling information dynamics**

Funding: 2 yrs post-doc fellowship from the Institut de Convergence `ILCB <https://www.ilcb.fr/>`_, May 2019 - April 2021

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (co-PI), Demian Battaglia (co-PI; INS, Marseille; USIAS, Strasbourg)

*The project aims at developping an multi-area interacting model based on the ring model. The goal is to study neural computations such as stimulus encoding, information transfer and information modification by means of simulation studies. This projet is part of Institut de Convergence ILCB.*

**The influence of directional interactions in brain networks in predicting cognitive deficits post-stroke**

Funding: FLAG-ERA HBP Partnering project, Jan 2018 - dec 2020

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (co-PI), Marizio Corbetta (PI; Univ Padova, Italy)

*The project aims to develop and test methods for the analysis of directional interactions among brain regions in resting state and task-evoked fMRI data in healthy controls and stroke damaged individuals, and to develop a computational model of an injured brain that replicates both the empirically measured patterns of connectivity abnormalities and behavioral deficits.*
