**Cognitive architectures of causal learning**

Funding: Agence Nationale de la Recherche ANR, Jan 2019 - Jun 2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Mateus Joffily (GATE, Lyon), Mehdi Khamassi (ISIR, Paris), Julien Bastin (GIN, Grenoble)

*The aim of this project is to study the neural and computational bases of human goal-directed causal learning by combining human neurophysiology (MEG and intracranial SEEG) and neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques with computational models of learning (Reinforcement Learning and Active Inference)*

**Model-free and model-based inference and validation workflows for causal brain network discovery**

Funding: Human Brain Project HBP/EBRAINS, Oct 2020 - March 2023

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (PI), Etienne Combrisson (post-doc INT), Jean Daunizeau (ICM, Paris), Gustavo Deco (UPF, Barcelona), Stefano Panzeri (IIT, Italy), Petra Ritter (Charit√©, Berlin), Olivier David (GIN, Grenoble)

The project aims at combining data-driven and model-based approaches for the inference of brain causal connectivity and the validation of whole-brain models. The goal is to integrate workflows and methods into EBRAINS. This projet is part of WP1 of SGA3 of the HBP.

**Modelling information dynamics**

Funding: 2 yrs post-doc fellowship from `ILCB <https://www.ilcb.fr/>`_, May 2019 - May 21

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (co-PI), Demian Battaglia (co-PI; INS, Marseille; USIAS, Strasbourg)

The project aims at developping an multi-area interacting model based on the ring model. The goal is to study neural computations such as stimulus encoding, information transfer and information modification by means of simulation studies. This projet is part of `Institut de Convergence ILCB <https://www.ilcb.fr/>`_.

Funding: FLAG-ERA HBP Partnering project, Jan 2018 - dec 2020

Consortium: Andrea Brovelli (co-PI), Michele Allegra (post-doc), Marizio Corbetta (PI; Univ Padova, Italy)
